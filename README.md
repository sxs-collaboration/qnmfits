# Welcome to qnmfits

`qnmfits` is an open-source Python code for least-squares fitting of quasinormal modes to ringdown waveforms.
The code is designed to interface with the [`sxs`](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/sxs) and [`scri`](https://github.com/moble/scri) packages, which allows for easy loading and transformations of SXS waveforms (including CCE waveforms) - but any waveform data can be used.
Quasinormal-mode frequencies and spherical-spheroidal mixing coefficients are loaded via the [`qnm`](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/qnm) package, and multimode fitting across multiple spherical-harmonic modes with mode mixing is handled automatically.
<!-- Additionally, it is equipped with a 'greedy' algorithm that picks the most important modes to model based on their power contribution to the residual between numerical and model waveforms.  -->

## Installation

qnmfits is available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qnmfits):

```bash
conda install conda-forge::qnmfits
```

 and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qnmfits/):

```bash
pip install qnmfits
```

### From source

git clone git@github.com:sxs-collaboration/qnmfits.git
cd qnmfits
pip install .
```

## Usage

Perform a seven-overtone fit to the (2,2) mode of SXS:BBH_ExtCCE:0001:

```python
import numpy as np
import qnmfits

# Download SXS:BBH_ExtCCE:0001
abd = qnmfits.cce.load(1)

# Transform to the superrest frame. First, shift the times for convenience:
h22 = abd.h.data[:, abd.h.index(2, 2)]
abd.t -= abd.t[np.argmax(np.abs(h22))]

# Map to the superrest frame
abd_prime = qnmfits.utils.to_superrest_frame(abd, t0=300)

# Get the strain and remnant mass and spin
h = abd_prime.h
Mf = abd_prime.bondi_rest_mass()[-1]
chif = np.linalg.norm(abd_prime.bondi_dimensionless_spin()[-1])

# QNMs we want to fit for. The format is (ell, m, n, sign), where sign is +1
# for "regular" (positive real part) modes, and -1 is for "mirror" (negative
# real part) modes.
qnms = [(2, 2, n, 1) for n in range(7+1)]

# Spherical modes we want to fit to. The format is (ell, m).
spherical_modes = [(2, 2)]

# Ringdown start time
t0 = 0.

# Perform the fit
best_fit = qnmfits.fit(
    data=h,
    chif=chif,
    Mf=Mf,
    qnms=qnms,
    spherical_modes=spherical_modes,
    t0=t0
)

print(f"Mismatch = {best_fit['mismatch']}")
```

The mismatch should be of order 1E-7.
Please see the notebooks in `examples` for additional code usage.
