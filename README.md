# Welcome to qnmfits

`qnmfits` is an open-source Python code for least-squares fitting of quasinormal modes to ringdown waveforms.
The code is designed to interface with the [`sxs`](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/sxs) and [`scri`](https://github.com/moble/scri) packages, which allows for easy loading and transformations of SXS waveforms (including CCE waveforms) - but any waveform data can be used.
Quasinormal-mode frequencies and spherical-spheroidal mixing coefficients are loaded via the [`qnm`](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/qnm) package, and multimode fitting across multiple spherical-harmonic modes with mode mixing is handled automatically.
<!-- Additionally, it is equipped with a 'greedy' algorithm that picks the most important modes to model based on their power contribution to the residual between numerical and model waveforms.  -->

## Installation

qnmfits is available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qnmfits):

```bash
conda install conda-forge::qnmfits
```

 and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qnmfits/):

```bash
pip install qnmfits
```

### From source

## A note on QNM labeling

In this package QNMs are specified with four numbers: `(ell, m, n, sign)`. The first three numbers refer to the usual angular (`ell`), azimuthal (`m`), and overtone (`n`) indices. The fourth number is either `+1` or `-1`, and refers to the sign of the real part of the QNM frequency. In other words, `sign=1` refers to the "regular" QNMs to the right of the imaginary axis, and `sign=-1` refers to "mirror" QNMs to the left of the imaginary axis. Note that this is different to the prograde (co-rotating) and retrograde (counter-rotating) classification you sometimes see.

For data which the `qnm` package can't compute (for example, the special $(2,2,8)$ "multiplet"), additional data can be downloaded with the code
```python
import qnmfits
qnmfits.download_cook_data()
```
which downloads the Cook & Zalutskiy data from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10093311).
Note that there are different labelling conventions for these multiplets. For example, the Schwarzschild $(2,2,8)$ QNM has the behaviour of "splitting" into two branches when the spin is increased:

![QNM multiplet taxonomy](https://github.com/eliotfinch/qnmfits/raw/main/examples/qnm_multiplet_taxonomy.png)

This has led to these two branches being labelled as $(2,2,8_0)$ and $(2,2,8_1)$ by Cook & Zalutskiy ([arxiv:1607.07406](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07406)). However, from a practical perspective we will be mostly working with Kerr black holes, and these two branches behave as a $n=8$ and $n=9$ overtone. So, as indicated by the figure above, we label them as such (this follows the convention of Forteza & Mourier ([arXiv:2107.11829](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11829))).

## Usage

Perform a seven-overtone fit to the (2,2) mode of SXS:BBH_ExtCCE:0001:

```python
import numpy as np
import qnmfits

# Download SXS:BBH_ExtCCE:0001
abd = qnmfits.cce.load(1)

# Transform to the superrest frame. First, shift the times for convenience:
h22 = abd.h.data[:, abd.h.index(2, 2)]
abd.t -= abd.t[np.argmax(np.abs(h22))]

# Map to the superrest frame
abd_prime = qnmfits.utils.to_superrest_frame(abd, t0=300)

# Get the strain and remnant mass and spin
h = abd_prime.h
Mf = abd_prime.bondi_rest_mass()[-1]
chif = np.linalg.norm(abd_prime.bondi_dimensionless_spin()[-1])

# QNMs we want to fit for. The format is (ell, m, n, sign), where sign is +1
# for "regular" (positive real part) modes, and -1 is for "mirror" (negative
# real part) modes.
qnms = [(2, 2, n, 1) for n in range(7+1)]

# Spherical modes we want to fit to. The format is (ell, m).
spherical_modes = [(2, 2)]

# Ringdown start time
t0 = 0.

# Perform the fit
best_fit = qnmfits.fit(
    data=h,
    chif=chif,
    Mf=Mf,
    qnms=qnms,
    spherical_modes=spherical_modes,
    t0=t0
)

print(f"Mismatch = {best_fit['mismatch']}")
```

The mismatch should be of order 1E-7.
Please see the notebooks in `examples` for additional code usage.
